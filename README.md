## Description
Using a panorama of the milky way this experiment allows you to see the effect on light pollution in a direct and emotional way. While basking in the beauty of the thousands of stars a transparent layer will vary his opaqueness based on the light pollution data from OASI and a artificial voice will tell the day of the week of the current data point.
